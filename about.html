Da Kasi originated in Taiwan<br> in 1990, established a company in Guangzhou in December 1998,<br> and opened the first Taiwanese take-away chain beverage store<br> in Beijing Road in April 1999.<br><br>
It mainly operates fresh tea drinks in Taiwan, and is popular<br> in Yangcheng with its advantages of freshness, convenience and<br> unique flavor, and has quickly opened branches throughout the <br> country. In order to meet the increasing demands of customers for<br> health and fashion,Dacas has continuously developed new products <br>for market demand. Each product will be strictly matched with <br>raw materials and technology. Each new product will be prepared <br> with the joy of trying to be the most loved one.
After more than<br> 20 years of modulation for love, the store outlets have spread all<br> over China and Southeast Asian countries, with huge brand <br>influence, and is a well-known brand of fresh tea in China.</div>

        <div class="pr2" style="font-size: 1vw">In 1990, a bubble black tea shop featuring Hollywood blockbusters <br>featured in the store, and trials in Ximending, Taiwan. At that <br>time, many college students and some fashion people often met in<br> groups of three and five to meet the "big card", while chatting<br>and enjoying a good drink. Over time, the fashion people who like<br> to gather in the "Dacus" have resonated with the specialty drinks <br>of the Grand Caska: I feel that every time the drinks and drinks <br>in this store are good, the cups are distinctive and feel like<br> Watching Hollywood blockbusters is as classic.<br> <br>So, everyone used to call us "big card"!</div>
